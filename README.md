# Cribb Frontend

Cribb is an open-source roommate-management platform that helps apartment groups coordinate **chores**, **shared pantry inventory**, and **shopping lists** in one place.  

This repository contains the **mobile-first Angular&nbsp;19** client.

> The REST API lives in `/CribbBackend` and is written in Go 1.23.

## Architecture & Key Concepts

| Layer            | Details |
| ---------------- | ------- |
| **Standalone Components** | All feature areas (`chores`, `pantry`, `shopping-cart`, ‚Ä¶) are implemented as *standalone* Angular components for faster lazy-loading and simplified module management. |
| **Signals & RxJS** | Some services (e.g. `shopping-cart.service.ts`) use Angular **Signals** for state, while others expose classic RxJS `BehaviorSubject`s. |
| **NgIcons + Iconoir** | Consistent iconography via `@ng-icons/iconoir`; icons are provided locally in each component to keep bundle size low. |
| **Tailwind CSS** | Design system is enforced with Tailwind utility classes plus small SCSS helpers. |
| **Cypress** | End-to-end flows are covered by Cypress specs in `cypress/`. |

## Environments

API calls default to `http://localhost:8080`. Override using **environment files** in `src/environments/` or by setting `NG_APP_API_URL` when deploying.

---

## Code Scaffolding

```bash
ng generate component feature/MyAwesomeCmp         # standalone by default
ng generate service  services/my-awesome           # providedIn:'root'
```

Use `ng generate --help` for the full schematic list.

## Build & Deploy

1. `ng build --configuration production` ‚Üí static assets in `dist/cribb-frontend/`.
2. Deploy to any static host (e.g. Vercel, Netlify). A ready-made `vercel.json` is included for zero-config Vercel deploys.
